# Wordle-Clone-using-Prolog
For this project, I created a modified version of the New York Times' game 'Wordle' using Prolog.
In order to play it, first you build your own knowledge base by entering a word and its category. Then, the player picks a category out of the available ones and the length of the word that they'd like to guess. User is given a number of guesses that is more than the word length by one, and they can begin playing.
